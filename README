# ef - The commmand you run after cd

On most of the repos I download to try things the usual flow to install or build the program is:

```
git clone <repo> <folder>
cd <folder>
more instructions...
```

At the same time, most of this instructions are very well explained in the project README file.
What if we could just run a command that would parse this commands and run them for us

### Roadmap

- [ ] Parse the README file and get the commands
- [ ] Present the commands to the user so that he can choose which one to run
- [ ] Run the command
